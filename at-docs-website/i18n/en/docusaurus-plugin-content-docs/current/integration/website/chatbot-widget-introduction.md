## Getting Started Quickly

To integrate the chatbot component into your project, follow these steps:

### 1. Obtain API-Key

To use the chatbot component, you first need to create an account and obtain an API-Key. For specific steps, please refer to [Creating an Account and Obtaining an API-Key](../../quick-start/create-account-and-get-api-token.md).

Note: If your data is publicly accessible, you can apply for an `asker` role API-Key. This API-Key only grants permission to converse with the AI bot, so there is no concern about exposure. You can use it directly in the frontend.

### 2. Embed the Component
