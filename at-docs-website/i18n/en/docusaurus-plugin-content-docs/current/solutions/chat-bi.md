# Conversational BI (Chat BI)

AskTable ChatBI is an intelligent data querying solution based on advanced large language models (LLM).

It integrates functions such as intent recognition, knowledge retrieval, question parsing, data querying, and visual output. Users can quickly obtain data analysis results by simply posing natural language questions, thereby facilitating rapid decision-making.

## Solves What Problems

- **Corporate Executives**
  - Need to find data analysts to get data, which is inefficient and slows down decision-making, lacking flexibility.
  - For example, when discussing a new project, quick data retrieval is necessary. If done through a data analyst, it takes too long. With ChatBI, answers can be provided quickly.
  
- **Frontline Business Users**
  - Data analysis is difficult to get started with; SQL has a high entry barrier.
  - Requires understanding of business, data, and technology—all three are essential.

## Product Value

- **Shift from "Finding People" to "Finding the System":** Immediate responses without relying on the data team.
  
- **Faster Data Retrieval:** Days to minutes.

## How to Integrate AskTable ChatBI with an Existing BI System

- No need to replace the existing BI system.
- Simply integrate AskTable ChatBI’s [API](../api-overview/introduction.md) into your current BI system.
- Any BI system based on databases like MySQL, which AskTable supports ([supported databases](../datasource-management/supported-databases.md)), can be integrated.
- No need for data synchronization and replication; share existing databases and data warehouses, automatically identify database tables, and go live in as little as one week.
