:::note Notes
1️⃣ **99 yuan/month** includes `500` queries; charges apply for any additional queries at **0.2 yuan/query**.

2️⃣ Due to resource limitations, the single machine version only provides basic functions and does not support [AI Search](https://docs.asktable.com/docs/ai-search/introduction), hence accuracy is not fully optimized.

3️⃣ For the single machine trial version, **the software is free**, but compute power charges apply.
   - Compute power pricing:
     - Charges based on actual usage, each query consumes a certain amount of compute power.
     - You can purchase compute power packages at https://cloud.asktable.com and view the fee consumption logs.
     - Estimated price: **0.2-0.5 yuan/query**

4️⃣ For local deployment A, the price includes both **software** and **compute power**.
   - Software pricing:
     - Up to `10` tables, **9,000 yuan/year**, includes a value-added **2,000 yuan** compute power package.
     - Up to `100` tables, **50,000 yuan/year**, includes a value-added **10,000 yuan** compute power package.
     - Up to `500` tables, **100,000 yuan/year**, includes a value-added **30,000 yuan** compute power package.
     - For more tables, please contact us for large client discounts.
