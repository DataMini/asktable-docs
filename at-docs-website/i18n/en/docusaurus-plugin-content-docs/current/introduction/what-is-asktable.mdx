## Application Scenarios

### **AI Business Data Analyst**

The traditional data analysis process is cumbersome, requiring finding people and systems, writing SQL, and creating reports, often taking several days. AskTable makes this process minute-level, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and quickly get analysis results without relying on the data team.

### **AI Corporate Knowledge Base**

Corporate smart assistants and knowledge base systems typically handle unstructured data (such as documents, emails, logs, etc.). AskTable can serve as a database access layer, enabling these AI systems to directly query and analyze structured data (such as sales data, factory data, financial data, etc.), greatly expanding the capabilities of AI applications.

### **Legacy System AI Plug-in**

Many companies still use traditional OA/ERP systems. Due to long-term lack of maintenance and upgrades, some data cannot be queried through the system itself. By integrating AskTable, you can directly access the underlying database, bypassing system limitations to obtain the required data without needing to modify or upgrade the original system.

## Technical Explanation

AskTable is designed specifically for structured data retrieval and analysis. Its main function is to generate data query instructions automatically through natural language queries, providing immediate results. This allows users to easily search and utilize structured data from sources like Excel, databases, and data warehouses without traditional querying methods.

AskTable offers four solutions: SaaS, a free standalone version, local deployment using model APIs, and carrying the model for local deployment. These solutions include various integration forms such as Restful API, SDK, and SaaS to meet different scenario requirements.

AskTable's goal is to become the infrastructure for AI applications accessing structured data.
