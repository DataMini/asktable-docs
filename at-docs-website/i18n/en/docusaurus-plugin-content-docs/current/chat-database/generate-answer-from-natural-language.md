# API: Natural Language Query Count

## Overview

AskTable provides an API endpoint for generating SQL from natural language queries and directly returning the query results. Through this API, developers can leverage AskTable's natural language processing capabilities to quickly retrieve information from databases. This is particularly useful for scenarios where simplifying the query process and improving development efficiency are required.

Applicable Scenarios:
1. Developers want users to be able to directly obtain data through natural language queries without having to handle the generation and execution of SQL statements themselves.
2. Developers do not want to use AskTableâ€™s UI interface and prefer to implement their own UI to directly display query results.
3. Developers wish to offer flexible query methods suitable for various user scenarios.

## API Endpoint
**POST** `/single-turn/q2a`

## Request Payload
The request payload must include the following fields:

```json
{
  "datasource_id": "string",
  "role_id": "string",
  "role_variables": {},
  "question": "string",
  "max_rows": 0
}
```

### Field Descriptions
- `datasource_id` (required): Data source ID, specifying the data source to be queried.
- `role_id` (optional): User role ID, used for permission control.
- `role_variables` (optional): Role-related variables, typically used to refine permission control.
- `question` (required): The user's natural language query.
- `max_rows` (optional): Limits the maximum number of rows returned; setting it to 0 returns all results.

## Example Request
Below is an example request to generate an SQL query and retrieve the query results:

### Request Example Code (Python)
```python
import requests

url = "https://api.asktable.com/v1/single-turn/q2a"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer API_KEY_or_TEMP_TOKEN",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
    "datasource_id": "example_datasource_id",
    "role_id": 1,
    "role_variables": {"user_id": 123},
    "question": "How many countries are there?",
    "max_rows": 10
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

## Response
A successful response will return the query results, including the generated SQL, execution time, and query results. A typical response example is as follows:

```json
{
    "status": "OK",
    "elapsed_time": 6,
    "text": "There are 206 countries.",
    "files": null,
    "charts": null,
    "query_insights": [
        {
            "datasource_id": "ds_32r3zkHMPKn21O6SMPlF0u",
