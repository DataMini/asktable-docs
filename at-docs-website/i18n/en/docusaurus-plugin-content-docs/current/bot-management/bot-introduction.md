# Custom Bots
Welcome to the AskTable Custom Bot documentation! This document will guide you on how to create and manage your intelligent chatbots, and how they can help resolve issues and enhance user experience.

# What is a Bot?
A bot, or chatbot, is a program capable of engaging in natural language conversations with users. It is designed to simulate human dialogue and can perform various tasks and provide services, ranging from simple information queries to complex interactive operations.

In AskTable, you can customize and configure your bot to meet your business and user needs. Each bot has its unique identity and abilities, performing tasks and answering user queries based on set rules and data sources.

# What Issues Can Bots Help Solve?

* **Natural Language Communication**: Users can communicate with the bot using natural language without needing to learn complex commands or syntax.
* **Multilingual Support**: Supports multiple languages, including Chinese and English, making your service more global.
* **Conversation History and Contextual Memory**: The bot can remember previous conversation content and context, better understanding the user's intent and needs.
* **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) Capability**: It not only answers queries but also performs corresponding actions based on user requests, such as placing orders or booking services.
* **Identity Recognition**: Can recognize user identity and roles, performing different actions based on varied permissions, like employees ordering food or customers querying product information.
