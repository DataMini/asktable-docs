# JoyShare Education & AskTable

Release Date: December 2024

## Customer Background

JoyShare Education is a well-known education group in Henan Province, owning multiple brand businesses including the JoyShare Smart Campus Management Platform, JoyShare Garden, and JoyShare Customized Services. Leveraging artificial intelligence technology, the company is dedicated to providing comprehensive solutions for teaching and learning for schools, teachers, and students.

In daily operations, JoyShare Education frequently needs to query and analyze massive amounts of data, such as national yearbook statistics, educational statistics, internal business operation data, etc.

However, faced with a large volume of data and diverse business needs, traditional manual query methods are inefficient and have high thresholds, especially making it difficult to meet immediate query requirements in mobile scenarios. These pain points limit the efficient use of data and affect decision-making efficiency.

## Customer Value

In October of this year, JoyShare Education began introducing AskTable to address these issues and achieve intelligent upgrades in data query methods:

### 1. Instant Queries, Enhanced Decision Efficiency

AskTable's natural language query function allows business personnel to ask questions through voice or text anytime and anywhere, quickly obtaining the required data without relying on data analysts. Queries that used to take over 30 minutes of multiple rounds of communication can now be completed in just one minute.

- For example: "Analyze the distribution of primary and secondary school students across various cities in Henan Province."

- For example: "Compare the average scores of each subject."

</div>

### 2. Reduced Data Acquisition Costs

Traditional query methods require complex reporting systems and significant human resources, while AskTable only requires simple configuration to access local databases such as MySQL and Hive, eliminating the need for additional system development. With support from online large model APIs, companies do not need to purchase GPU hardware, directly reducing computational costs.

### 3. Increased Data Utilization

Through AskTable, JoyShare Education has achieved full utilization of its data assets. Business personnel no longer abandon queries due to technical barriers, allowing massive educational data to be used more efficiently, providing solid decision support for business growth.

## Usage Cost

### 1. Quick Deployment, Easy Setup

It took only half an hour to deploy AskTable on a 4-core 16GB machine. Data is accessed locally, eliminating concerns about data leakage.
- Simple Configuration: Just input the database address, and AI automatically builds and recognizes data models, requiring no manual intervention.

### 2. Zero Hardware Upgrade Costs

AskTable’s online large model API avoids the high cost of purchasing GPUs by the company. Even on ordinary-configured machines, it runs smoothly, directly reducing usage costs by an order of magnitude.

### 3. Low Learning Curve

No additional technical training is required; business and operational personnel can directly perform natural language queries and obtain results without mastering SQL or complex tools.

## Product Highlights

### 1. Natural Language Query, Improved Query Experience

By asking questions directly through natural language, AskTable automatically generates precise query commands and returns answers. Whether for simple data extraction or complex statistical analysis, tasks can be completed quickly, greatly simplifying the data access process.

### 2. High Performance Supporting Multiple Databases

AskTable supports connections to multiple databases (such as MySQL and Hive), capable of quickly handling multi-table join queries, easily meeting JoyShare Education’s demand for multi-source massive data.

### 3. Portability and Real-Time Capabilities Combined

Supports embedding on mobile devices, allowing business personnel to query key data anytime and anywhere on their phones, enabling efficient decision-making regardless of location.

### 4. Data Security Assurance

AskTable’s private deployment capability ensures that all data access runs locally, meeting the high standards for data security in the education industry.
