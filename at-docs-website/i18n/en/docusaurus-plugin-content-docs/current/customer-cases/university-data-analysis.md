# Conversational Data Analysis at a University in Shanghai

## Background

The president and management team of a university in Shanghai frequently need to query large amounts of school data, including student information and employment status. Due to the vast amount of data, traditional querying methods have made it difficult for the president to obtain specific reports when needed, requiring additional development to achieve real-time responses. Given the limited human resources, they cannot develop and manage professional data reports.

## Challenges

- **Data Complexity**: The university has a wide variety of internal data, such as student information and employment data, which requires precise data processing and analysis capabilities from the president during queries.
- **Real-Time Response**: Traditional data query methods cannot provide immediate responses. The president often needs to wait for additional development or manual processing when needed.
- **Resource Constraints**: There is a lack of specialized personnel for developing and managing large-scale data reports, making it difficult to effectively utilize existing data for decision-making and management.
