1. **Introduction**

Welcome to "AskTable"!

"AskTable" software and related services ("Platform") refer to services provided through web pages, applications (which may include different versions), software development kits (SDKs) for third-party websites and applications, application programming interfaces (APIs), and innovative forms of service delivery as technology evolves. You can use the services provided by AskTable to create chatbots (Bot) or data source (DataSource) related applications and software.

This user agreement ("Agreement") sets the terms and conditions for your registration, login, and usage ("Usage") of the service between you and us, including your access and use of the platform and our related websites, applications, products, models, services, software, tools, technological settings, content, and documentation (collectively, "the Service"). 

Please carefully read and fully understand this Agreement before using the Service, especially the provisions regarding the exemption or limitation of liability, rights licensing, applicable laws, and dispute resolution terms. **Important provisions, such as those involving liability exemption or limitation, are highlighted in bold text for your attention, and should be read carefully.**  
If you do not agree to the Agreement, we will not be able to provide you with complete services. You may also choose to stop using the service. If you choose to agree or use the service voluntarily, it will be deemed that you have fully understood the Agreement and agree to be bound by the Agreement and any related agreements and rules (including but not limited to the "Privacy Policy"). The terms of these agreements and rules can be found directly on the Platform. We may also publish operational rules, policies, guidelines, and procedures from time to time, which will be part of this Agreement.

To improve user experience and service quality, or to enhance security, we may update or modify parts or all of the Service (including but not limited to software/service modifications, upgrades, replacements, feature enhancements, and new service development) from time to time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you;  
You can stop using the Service at any time, though we regret that you choose to do so. We may also stop providing the Service to you, or add or set up new restrictions at any time.  
You acknowledge and agree that using the Service requires you to prepare relevant terminal devices (such as computers, mobile phones, etc.). Once you access the Service via a terminal device, it is considered that you are using the Service. To fully utilize all functions of the Service, you may need to connect your terminal device to the internet, and you understand that you are responsible for any required fees (such as data charges or internet fees).

2. **Acceptance of these Terms**

By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have the legal right to enter into a binding contract with Hangzhou Datou & Yue Technology Co., Ltd., and that you agree to and will abide by this Agreement.  
If you accept or use this Agreement on behalf of an enterprise or other entity, (1) "you" refers to both you and the enterprise or entity. (2) You declare and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the enterprise or entity, with the authority to obligate the entity to comply with these terms, and that you represent the entity in accepting these terms.

You understand and agree that from this point onwards, we will consider your access or use of the service as your acceptance of the Agreement. 

3. **Modification of these Terms**

To better provide you with services or due to changes in national laws and regulations, policies, technical conditions, product functions, etc., we reserve the right to modify the service terms at any time. We will make commercially reasonable efforts, such as through Platform notifications, to notify you of any significant changes to this Agreement. However, you are still advised to regularly check these terms for updates. We will also update the "Last Updated" date at the top of the terms to reflect the effective date of the changes.

4. **Your Account**

4.1 The "Unified Account Service" refers to the credentials you create based on the User Agreement of associated product versions (including AskTable, etc.) provided and operated by Hangzhou Datou & Yue Technology Co., Ltd., to log in and use associated product versions and services.  
The Unified Account Service refers to the service provided to you through multiple closely connected associated product versions, which use a unified account service. These associated versions include AskTable, etc. To ensure consistent service experience and seamless interconnectivity between associated versions, these associated versions use Datou & Yue's Unified Account Service, collectively gathering and processing your account information (e.g., nickname and ID). Registering and logging into your AskTable account will become a universal identifier for using the Unified Account Service, allowing you to log in and use other associated versions and access related services.  

4.2 We provide you with a registration channel through which you can register a Datou & Yue account using a mobile phone number or other methods allowed by us. Additionally, you can choose to use the third-party platform login functionality provided by us and log in to your Datou & Yue account with a legally owning third-party platform's account, except in cases where the third-party platform restricts or prohibits this. You should ensure that the third-party platform's account is verified with real identity information and complies with the relevant laws and regulations. After registration, you can set a secure login password for yourself. The account, password, and verification code you set are the credentials for logging in and using the software and related services as a registered user.  
You can use AskTable without logging in or registering an account, but you will be unable to access all the features of AskTable.  

4.3 If you no longer wish to use the Service, you can apply to have your account deleted. We will assist you in deleting your account and deleting all relevant information, provided you pass reasonable and necessary verification checks (such as personal identity, security status, device information, and infringement complaints). To request account deletion, please contact us at the following email address: **hi@datamini.ai**, and we will provide further assistance to guide you through the process. Alternatively, you can cancel your account on the platform's settings page. Once you choose to delete your account, you will not be able to reactivate or retrieve any content or information associated with the previously deleted account.  
Please ensure that you are applying to delete the unified account that was created and provided to you according to the terms of the User Agreement. You should proceed with the account deletion process as specified by us or as prompted on our website.

4.4 You understand and commit to ensuring that the account you set up does not violate national laws and regulations or our related rules. The account name, avatar, and profile, among other user information, must not include any illegal or inappropriate content. Without another personâ€™s permission, you may not use another person's name (including but not limited to impersonating other names, titles, icons, logos, etc., that could confuse users) to register an account, nor register maliciously (including but not limited to frequent registrations, mass registrations). Our company has the authority to review the information you submit. During the account registration and use process, you must comply with relevant laws and regulations and not engage in actions that harm national interests or damage the rightful interests of other citizens and violate the public moral standards.  

4.5 The account you register is for your personal use only. Without written consent from us, you are prohibited from transferring, giving, leasing, selling, lending, or allowing anyone else to use the account in any form. If we find or have reasonable grounds to believe that the account user is not the initial registrant, we reserve the right to immediately suspend or terminate services provided to the registered account and permanently disable the account to ensure security.  

4.6 You are responsible for maintaining the security and confidentiality of your account, password, and verification codes and bear full legal responsibility for any activities conducted under your registered account. This includes, but is not limited to, any possible legal liabilities arising from modifications to data, statements posted, or other operations performed on the Service. You need to be highly aware of the confidentiality of these details and should never reveal account, password, or verification codes to others under any circumstance. In the event that someone is using your account without permission or there is a security vulnerability, you should immediately notify us.  

4.7 If you lose your account, forget your password, or leak your verification code, you may report it to us in a timely manner to request recovery. You understand and acknowledge that our password recovery mechanism requires verifying that the information provided in the appeal matches the records in the system. However, it cannot confirm whether the person making the appeal is the rightful owner of the account. The company reminds you to store your account, password, and verification code properly. When you are done using them, you should ensure to log out safely. If you suffer a stolen account, password loss, or verification code leak as a result of your improper handling or other force majeure factors, you will be responsible for any resultant consequences.  

4.8 During the registration, use, and management of accounts, you should ensure that the identity information submitted during registration is authentic. Please use genuine, accurate, legal, and valid identification documents and personal information (including your name, email address, contact number, and address) during account registration and management. According to national laws and regulations, to use some functions of this service, you must provide genuine identity information. Please complete the real name certification according to relevant laws and pay attention to timely update the above information. If the documents submitted or information provided are inaccurate, untrue, non-compliant, or we have reasons to suspect they are wrong, false, or illegal, we may refuse to provide the corresponding functions, and you may be unable to use the software and related services or experience restricted functionalities during usage.  

4.9 After registering, logging into, and performing reasonable and necessary identity verification with the software, you can browse and modify the personal identity information you submitted at any time. You understand and agree that for the sake of security and identity verification (such as password recovery), you may not be able to modify the initial registration information and other verification details provided during registration.  

4.10 You understand and agree that to fully utilize account resources, if you do not log in and use the account after registration or have not logged in for over six continuous months, we reserve the right to reclaim the account. If your account is reclaimed, you may not be able to use the previously held account to log in or access services, and any personalized settings and usage records under that account will not be recoverable. Before reclaiming your account, the company will notify you in an appropriate manner. If you have not logged in or used the account within six months since receiving the notification, the company will proceed with account reclamation.  
If your account is reclaimed, you can register a new account to log into and use the service. Your registration of a new account and continued use are still subject to the relevant terms of this Agreement.  

4.11 If we believe that you have not adhered to any provisions of this Agreement, or may cause damage to the Service, or violate any third-party rights, or breach any applicable law or regulations, we reserve the right to disable your account, delete chatbots (Bot) you have created, and/or prohibit the distribution or publication of chatbots (Bot) you created on third-party platforms. To maintain a healthy platform ecosystem, we may adopt collaborative management measures for linked product versions. For example: if you are penalized in AskTable for violating laws, regulations, or the terms of this Agreement, your use of other linked versions and services may also be affected by these penalties, and vice versa.
