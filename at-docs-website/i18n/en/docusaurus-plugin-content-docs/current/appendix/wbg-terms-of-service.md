4. Your Account

4.1 Big Head and You Account ("Unified Account Service") refers to the service you create based on the user agreement of version-controlled products operated by Big Head and You (including CousinAsker, etc.), and it is used as your login credential and user identity for related version-controlled products and services.

Unified Account Service refers to the unified login service provided to you by us (Hangzhou Big Head and You Technology Co., Ltd.) via multiple functionally interconnected version-controlled products, including CousinAsker. To ensure consistent service experiences and compatibility between various versions, these versions use Big Head and Your Unified Account Service, collectively managing and processing your account information (such as nicknames and IDs). When you register and log in to a CousinAsker account, it becomes a universal identifier for using the Unified Account Service, allowing you to synchronize and access related services across associated products.

4.2 Our Service provides you with a registration channel where you can register a Big Head and You Account through a mobile phone number or other methods we permit. You can also choose to use our third-party platform account login function to register and log into a Big Head and You Account using a legally-owned third-party platform account, except in cases where the third-party platform restricts or forbids such actions. You should ensure that the third-party platform account you use has completed real-name verification and complies with relevant laws and regulations. After registration, you can set up a secure login password. The account, password, and verification code you receive are the credentials for logging in and using the software and related services.

You may use CousinAsker without logging in or registering, but you will not be able to access all features.

4.3 If you no longer wish to use this service, you can apply for account cancellation. After we complete reasonable and necessary verifications regarding your identity, security status, device information, and complaint of infringement, we will assist you in canceling your account and, based on your request, deleting all related information about your account, except where laws and regulations provide otherwise. If you wish to cancel your account, please contact us at the following email address: <hi@datamini.ai>. We will provide further assistance and guide you through the process, or you can cancel your account via the settings page on our platform. Once you choose to cancel your account, you will not be able to reactivate it or retrieve any content or information associated with the canceled account.

Ensure that the account you are applying to cancel is the one created according to the terms of the User Agreement and provided to you by us. You should follow the procedures we specify or the website prompts to cancel the aforementioned account.

4.4 You agree and promise that the account you set up must not violate national laws and regulations or our relevant rules. The registered information in your account name, avatar, and profile, as well as other personal information, must not contain illegal or inappropriate content. Without the permission of others, you may not use their names (including but not limited to impersonating another's real name, company name, business name, avatar, or any other identifiers that may cause confusion) to set up an account. Malicious registration behaviors, including frequent and batch registrations, are prohibited. We have the right to review the information you submit. You must comply with relevant laws and regulations during the registration and usage process, and you must not engage in any actions that harm national interests or infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other citizens, nor should you engage in any actions that harm social morals.

4.5 The account you registered is limited to your exclusive use. Without our written consent, it is prohibited to transfer, lend, rent, or otherwise license this account to others in any form. If we determine or have reasonable grounds to believe that the account user is not the initial registrant, we may immediately suspend or terminate the service provided to that account and permanently ban that account to ensure account security.

4.6 You have the responsibility to maintain the confidentiality and security of your account, password, and verification code, and you must bear full legal liability for all activities conducted under your registered account, including any data modifications, comments, payment operations, etc., conducted in this service. It is essential to take the confidentiality of your account, password, and verification code very seriously and not reveal them to others under any circumstances. If you discover unauthorized access to your account or any other security vulnerabilities, you should immediately notify us.

4.7 If you lose your account, forget your password, or leak your verification code, you may request help from us to recover it according to the reporting procedures. You understand and agree that our password recovery mechanism only requires confirmation of the consistency between the information on the complaint form and the system record and cannot verify whether the complainant is the rightful account holder. We especially remind you to properly manage your account, password, and verification code. After use, be sure to safely log out. If you suffer from unauthorized account access, password loss, or verification code leaks due to your own oversight or other unavoidable factors, you will be solely responsible for the consequences.

4.8 When registering, using, and managing your account, ensure that the identity information you provide is truthful. When completing registration and account management, use genuine, accurate, legal, and valid identification documents and necessary information (including your name, email address, phone number, and address). According to national laws and regulations, to use certain functionalities of the service, you need to submit genuine personal identification information. We require you to complete real-name authentication in accordance with relevant laws and regulations and keep this information updated. If the documents or information you provide are inaccurate, untruthful, or illegal, or if we have reason to doubt their accuracy, we reserve the right to refuse providing you with the relevant features, and you may not be able to use this software and related services or may experience limitations in certain functionalities.

4.9 After you complete the registration, login, and reasonable and necessary identity verification process for this software, you can browse and modify the personal identity information you submitted at any time. You understand and agree that for security and identity recognition reasons (such as account or password recovery), you may not be able to modify the initial registration information and other verification information you provided at the time of registration.

4.10 You agree that to make better use of account resources, if you do not log in and use your account after registration or do not log in for more than six consecutive months, we reserve the right to reclaim your account. If your account is reclaimed, you may not be able to log in and use this service through your previously held account, and any personalized settings and usage records under that account will be irrecoverable. Before reclaiming your account, we will notify you in an appropriate manner. If you do not log in or use the account within six months after receiving the relevant notification, we will proceed with the account reclamation.

If your account is reclaimed, you can log in and use this service by registering a new account. Your logging in and usage behavior with the new account will still be subject to the relevant provisions of this Agreement.

4.11 If we believe that you have failed to comply with any provisions of this Agreement, may cause damage to our Service, or violate any third-party rights or applicable laws or regulations, we reserve the right to disable your account, delete any chatbots (Bot) you created, and/or block the distribution or publication of chatbots (Bot) on third-party platforms. To maintain a healthy platform environment, we may implement coordinated management measures across associated products. For instance, if you are penalized for violating laws, regulations, or this Agreement in CousinAsker, your use of associated services and products may also be affected, and vice versa.
